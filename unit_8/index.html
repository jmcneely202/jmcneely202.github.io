			<h2>About M.O.R.S.</h2>
			<p>Our goal is simple: To provide readers a pragmatic approach to life's complexities. Many working professionals devote time and money to increasing their professional skills, but lack a basic understanding of how the world operates outside of their jobs. Whether it is explaining the process for applying for a mortgage, or the pros and cons of purchasing whole-life versus term-life insurance, having multiple perspectives when grappling with these decisions is helpful to finding what works best for an individual circumstance. The MORS Team realizes that information is useless without clear explanation and context. Our webiste is dedicated to the proposition that the better informed our readers are, the better their outcomes. We make complex subjects relevant and empower our readers to apply this knowledge to their daily lives.</p>
			<p>Topics covered by the MORS team span a wide variety of subject areas, including, but not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Law and Politics</li>
				<li>Current Events</li>
				<li>Lifestyle and Fitness</li>
				<li>Business, Financial Planning, and Real Estate</li>
				<li>Travel and Leisure</li>
				<li>Sports and Entertainment</li>
